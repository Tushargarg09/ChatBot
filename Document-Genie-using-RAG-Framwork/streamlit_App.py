## Health Assistant: Your Personal Medicine Recommendation Assistant
Health Assistant is a sophisticated chatbot built using the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, leveraging Google's Generative AI model Gemini-PRO. It analyzes patient-reported symptoms by processing the input data, creating a comprehensive understanding, and providing accurate medicine recommendations. This advanced approach ensures high-quality, contextually relevant responses for an efficient and effective healthcare experience.

### How It Works
Follow these simple steps to interact with Health Assistant:

1. **Enter Your API Key**: You'll need a Google API key for Health Assistant to access Google's Generative AI models. Obtain your API key here.

2. **Provide Your Symptoms**: Input your symptoms either by typing them in or uploading relevant medical documents. Health Assistant accepts multiple formats to ensure comprehensive analysis.

3. **Receive Medicine Recommendations**: After processing your symptoms, Health Assistant will suggest appropriate medicine options tailored to your condition for precise and effective treatment.

    Step 1: Identify Key Concepts
    - List all key concepts mentioned in the question.
    - Separate these concepts into those likely to be in the context and those that might be irrelevant or incorrect.
    

    Step 2: Scan the Context
    - Search the context for information related to each key concept from Step 1.
    - Note which concepts are present and which are absent in the context.

    Step 3: Find Nearest Relevant Information
    - For concepts present in the context, identify the most relevant information.
    - For concepts not directly mentioned, find the closest related information in the context.

    Step 4: Address Misconceptions
    - Identify any misconceptions in the question based on the context.
    - Prepare to correct these misconceptions using information from the context.

    Step 5: Formulate the Answer
    - Start by addressing any misconceptions or incorrect assumptions.
    - Provide information on the concepts present in the context, even if they differ from what was asked.
    - Explain why certain asked concepts are not applicable, if relevant.
    - Use the nearest relevant information for concepts not directly addressed in the context.

    Step 6: Summarize and Clarify
    - Provide a clear summary of the correct information from the context.
    - Explicitly state which parts of the question could not be answered from the given context.

    Step 7: Generate a final answer 
    -give a final answer based on step 6 and return the answer

    Remember:
    - Do not invent or assume information not provided.
